Homey app to view Oregon Scientific sensor info in Athom Homey

It can take a time before the app reads a interpretable signal from the sensor , wait an hour before trying to pair a device.

After battery change with reset the rolling code( last 2 hex digits from the name ) can be changed and the device should be repaired.

Only the RF 2.1 protocol from  oregon scientific can be read.



I have now 4 sensor devices  added the BTHR968 device id 5d60 (first for hex digits from name)  and the THGR122NX, THGN132ES, THGR228N device id 1d20 

install the THGN132ES or THGR228N as THGR122NX
